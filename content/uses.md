## Editor + Terminal

* I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/ "iTerm2") as my current terminal styled with [Starship](https://starship.rs/ "Starship"), you can check out the settings I have for it [here](https://github.com/brooksztb/dotfiles "here")
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "VS Code") for coding and development

## Desktop Apps

* [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/ "BetterTouchTool") is a great tool to customize the touch bar on MacBooks, I have a bunch of quick actions like volume control, play/pause, and check the weather
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/ "Figma") for working with designs and design files
* I use [Alfred]() over apple spotlight as I find it much more accurate for opening the files and apps I need
* I learned about this macro tool to enhance my note-taking experience with Obsidian called [Espanso](https://espanso.org/ "Espanso"), you can check my dotfiles repo for the configurations I am using currently for it
* I started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md "Obsidian") recently for note-taking, organizing my thoughts, and as a daily planner. I have been really enjoying it over Notion, which is what I was using previously.
